						<h2>Overview</h2>
						<p>The developer's guide explains the general architecture of the
							platform, how plugins (forms and visualizations) interact with it, how
							mobile apps may connect with the MIDATA platform
							and how plugins and mobile apps bring in and display data.
						</p>
						<p><em style="font-weight:bold;">Forms</em> connect data sources to
							the platform. They are built to bring data onto the platform, by
							giving the users the possibility to either create a record
							themselves, or importing it from another where it has originally
							been created. Forms may connect to other domains to fetch data but are
							not allowed to read records from the platform.
						</p>
						<p><em style="font-weight:bold;">Visualizations</em> display an
							aggregated view of the records that are passed to them. The
							purpose of visualizations is to foster the users' understanding of
							their own data. Visualizations may read and write records from and to the
							MIDATA platform but they may not connect to external domains.
						</p>
						<p><em style="font-weight:bold;">Mobile Apps</em> may connect to the MIDATA platform
						    in behalf of a user and write records to the users account. It may also read records
						    but only those created by the app itself and those the user has granted access to.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div id="accounts" class="tab-pane fade" ng-class="{ 'active in' : tab=='accounts' }">
						<h2>Developer Accounts</h2>
						<p>If you want to develop a MIDATA plugin or mobile app you need a developer account.
						   Please click on "Sign Up" on the top of this page and create your account. Using the 
						   developer account you can register a new plugin or mobile app and manage it. 
						</p>
						<p>If you are developing a plugin you can test your development version running on your own computer 
						   using the developer portal. When you are done with development you need to send the code to us for review
						   and final integration.
						</p> 
					</div>
					<div id="architecture" class="tab-pane fade" ng-class="{ 'active in' : tab=='architecture' }">
						<h2>Architecture</h2>
						<p>The platform promises not to give data out. To adhere to that 
							promise, plugins run on an isolated and sandboxed application 
							server, that can only connect to the web application server, and 
							therefore especially not to the internet.</p>
						<p>Plugins may be registered via your developer account but the final code version needs to be
						   deployed by us on the plugin server.</p>
					</div>
					<div id="apps" class="tab-pane fade" ng-class="{ 'active in' : tab=='apps' }">
						<h2>Forms</h2>
						<p>A form provides the functionality to let the user create or import a 
						record and to give a detailed view of a single instance of a record
						created or imported by that form. Two REST endpoints, whose address is
						specified when registering the app on the market, expose the interface
						to the web application server.</p>
						<h3>Registration on the market</h3>
						<p>An app has to specify a name and a textual description, that describe
						what it does. Additionally, addresses relative to the app's base directory
						state the endpoints that are called when creating or importing a new 
						record, or when displaying the details of a single record.</p>
						<h4>URL to create records</h4>
						<p>This URL will be called when a user wants to create or import a new
						record. The web page behind that address should either give users the
						possibility to enter data themselves, or allow them to import data from
						the source where it was originally created.</p>
						<p>The URL can be chosen arbitrarily, but it has to include a part with 
						the string <code>:replyTo</code>. This part will be replaced with a Base64
						encoded string representing the URL that the newly created record should
						be sent to. A possible URL could be:</p>
						<pre>create/:replyTo</pre>
						<h4>URL to detailed record view</h4>
						<p>The page at this address provides the user with a close look at a single
						record. This is necessary when the name of the record does not include 
						sufficient information for the user to decide what to do with it, and 
						closer inspection is required.</p>
						<p>The URL for this request is again arbitrary, but must contain a part 
						with <code>:record</code>, that will be replaced with a Base64 encoded 
						representation of the record's data field. An example might look like
						this:</p>
						<pre>details/:record</pre>
						<h3>Creation/Import of a new record</h3>
						<p>This is how the data gets onto the platform. The GET request to the 
						specified URL includes the address that the reply should be directed to.
						When the user entered an AJAX request is sent to that address containing
						the following parameters:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>"data": A JSON string with the data to be stored.</li>
							<li>"name": A name for the record that is displayed in the record list
							and as a title of a search result.</li>
							<li>"description": A textual description of the record that is indexed
							by the search server. It is used when the user conducts a fulltext 
							search.</li>
						</ul>
						<h3>Detailed view of a single record</h3>
						<p>After the record has been pushed onto the platform and into a user's 
						account, the user must have a way to check the contents of that record.
						Since in the beginning, only the app knows how the record looks like, it
						must also give a view of a single record, that displays the important 
						facts of the record, so that the user can manage it accordingly, i.e.
						decide whether to share it and in which spaces to put it.</p>
					</div>
					<div id="visualizations" class="tab-pane fade" ng-class="{ 'active in' : tab=='visualizations' }">
						<h2>Visualizations</h2>
						<p>Visualizations aggregate a set of records and display interesting 
						characteristics to the user. It is called with the set of records, that
						the user determined, at the address given when the app was registered in
						the market.</p>
						<h3>Registration on the market</h3>
						<p>When registering a visualization on the market, the developer has to
						give a name and a textual description. This is shown to the user and 
						should capture the purpose and capabilities of the visualization best.</p>
						<h4>URL</h4>
						<p>The third property that has to be specified is the URL that will be 
						called with the records selected to be displayed by the app. The URL is 
						relative to the visualization's base directory and can be chosen 
						arbitrarily. It only has to include a part that contains the string
						<code>:records</code>. This part will be replaced with a Base64 encoded 
						JSON string containing the records passed to the visualization. An example
						of a visualization URL could look like this:</p>
						<pre>view/:records</pre>
						<h3>Data passed to the visualization</h3>
						<p>The records come as a Base64 encoded JSON string,
						representing an array of the data fields of the assigned records.
						The data field contains exactly what was passed to the platform at
						creation/import time (cf. Apps section, "Creation/Import of a new
						record").</p>
						<h3>Handling of heterogeneous records</h3>
						<p>It is the visualization's responsibility to check that the records
						passed to it are in the correct format. The users are free to assign any 
						records to a visualization, and can therefore also include records the
						visualization might not understand. It is up to the devloper's 
						implementation to decide on how to handle these cases.</p>
					</div>
					<div id="mobile" class="tab-pane fade" ng-class="{ 'active in' : tab=='mobile' }">
						<h2>Mobile Apps</h2>
						<p>Mobile Apps are external applications that provide and/or query records from the platform.</p>
						<h3>Registration using the developer account</h3>					
						<p>Each app needs to have an internal name that is used by the platform to identify that app.
						The app developer also needs to specify a public name for the marked place and a textual description, that describe
						what it does. Also a secret key needs to be entered that is known to the mobile app but should not be made public.</p>
						<p>To register your app, log in into your developer account. On the "Your Plugins" page click on "Register a new plugin" and fill out the form.
						   Choose "Mobile App" as "type" of the plugin. 
						   <i>In the current release do not select "Spotlight in Market". (will be removed)</i>
						   Click on "Submit" when you are done.
						</p>
						<h3>Initialization of the app</h3>
						<p>After the mobile app has been installed on a smartphone it needs to register with the
						   MIDATA server and receive an app instance token ONCE. That instance token must be stored by
						   the app on the smartphone and is required during authentication. If the instance token is lost and 
						   a new one is requested the app will loose access to all data shared with it.</p>
						<p>To request the app instance token this request is needed:</p>
						<pre><i>POST</i> /api/mobile/init</pre>
						<p>with these parameters as JSON body:</p>
<pre>{
  "appname" : internal name of the application,
  "secret" : the secret key that has been chosen on the development portal
}</pre>
                        <p>In response you will receive a JSON with the instance token like this:</p>
<pre>{
  "instanceToken" : "6c333a3b42e64220...8f49a49a19af46"
}</pre>
                        <h3>Authentication (Login)</h3>						
						<p>A mobile app needs to authenticate using a users credentials to the platform before providing or querying records.
						To authenticate call:</p> 
						<pre><i>POST</i> /api/mobile/auth</pre>
						<p>with these parameters as JSON body:</p>
<pre>{ 
	  "instanceToken" : the token the app had received from the "init" request, 	  
	  "username" : the email of the user, 
	  "password" : password of user 
}</pre>						
					    <p>As result you either get a 400 status with an error message or a session tokens that can be used for further requests.</p>
						<p>An example response looks like this:</p>
<pre>{
  "authToken":"014760..."
}</pre>
                        <p>After the first login of a user using the mobile app a new "consent" is automatically created in the users MIDATA account.
                           This consent may be used by the user to select which data he/she wants to share with your mobile app.
                           Initially this consent does not share any data so that your app will see a blank account. However the app is allowed to create
                           records and is automatically granted access to the records it has created.
                        </p>  
						<h3>Creating new records</h3>
						<p>To create a new record call this endpoint:</p>
						<pre><i>POST</i> /api/mobile/records/create</pre>
						<p>The request needs a JSON body with these parameters:</p>
<pre>{
     "authToken" : the token from the authentication request, 
     "name" : a name for the record, 
     "description" : a description for the record,
     "format" : a string describing the technical data format,
     "content" : a string describing the data content
     "data" : JSON string containing the record itself 
}</pre>						




                        <h3>Retrieving existing records</h3>
                        <p>To retrieve records call this endpoint:</p>
                        <pre><i>POST</i> /api/mobile/records/search</pre>
                        <p>The request needs a JSON body with these parameters:</p>
<pre>{
     "authToken": the token from the authentication request,
     "fields" : a string array of field names to return,
     "properties" : a key-value map with restrictions. (May be empty) 
}</pre>           
<p>Possible values for <code>fields</code> are:
  <ul>  
    <li><code>_id</code> - the internal id of the record</li>    
    <li><code>owner</code> - the id of the owner of the record (or null if not public)</li>
    <li><code>ownerName</code> - the owner of the record as string (firstname lastname)</li>
    <li><code>creator</code> - the id of the creator of the record (or null if not public)</li>
    <li><code>creatorName</code> - the creator of the record as string (firstname lastname)</li>
    <li><code>format</code> - the technical format of the record</li>
    <li><code>content</code> - the semantical format of the record</li>
    <li><code>group</code> - the name of the group where this record is listed in the data tree</li>
    <li><code>app</code> - the id of the app that created this record</li>
    <li><code>created</code> - the date of creation of this record</li>
    <li><code>name</code> - the name of this record</li>
    <li><code>description</code> - the description of this record</li>
    <li><code>tags</code> - an array of tags for this record</li>
    <li><code>data</code> - the data of this record as string or json</li>
 </ul>
<p>Each key in the properties map restricts the returned records by one criteria.</p>
<p>Each values in the properties map may be either a single value or an array of multiple values.
In the array case each record must match one entry in the array to qualify for the query.</p>
<p>Possible keys for <code>properties</code> are: (only those listed that are currently supported)
  <ul>  
    <li><code>_id</code> - (id) restrict by id of the record</li>
    <!--     
    <li><code>owner</code> - (id/string) restrict by owner id of the record. The following special string values are allowed as value for this restriction:
       <ul>
         <li><code>self</code> - only records from the account owner</li>
         <li><code>other</code> - only records not from the account owner</li>
         <li><code>shared</code> - only records from the account owner that have been shared</li>

    <li><code>creator</code> - (id) only records with a specific creator</li>
    <li><code>limit</code> - (integer) the maximum count of records you want to receive</li>    
 </ul>
 <p>The response to the query is an array of records having only the fields you requested.</p>  
   

















<h3>Summary Query</h3>
  <p>If the app needs an overview about how many records are there, what formats or groups they belong to and/or how old
     they are a summary query may help. Please note that on larger data sets a summary query will be executed much faster than
     a regular query.</p>
  <p>For a summary query call this endpoint:</p>
  <pre><i>POST</i> /api/mobile/records/summary</pre>
                        <p>The request needs a JSON body with these parameters:</p>
<pre>{
     "authToken": the token from the authentication request,
     "summarize" : the level of grouping required,
     "properties" : a key-value map with restrictions. (May be empty) 
}</pre>           
<p>Possible values for <code>summarize</code> parameter are:
  <ul>  
    <li><code>ALL</code> - returns one entry summarizing everything</li>    
    <li><code>GROUP</code> - returns one entry for each group</li>
    <li><code>FORMAT</code> - returns one entry for each format used</li>
    <li><code>CONTENT</code> - returns one entry for each content (type) used</li>
    <li><code>SINGLE</code> - returns one entry for each different type of record</li>    
 </ul>
<p>Each key in the properties map restricts the returned records by one criteria.</p>
<p>Each values in the properties map may be either a single value or an array of multiple values.
In the array case each record must match one entry in the array to qualify for the query.</p>
<p>Possible keys for <code>properties</code> are: (only those listed that are currently supported)
  <ul>      
    <li><code>format</code> - (string) the technical format of the record</li>
    <li><code>content</code> - (string) the semantical format of the record</li>
    <li><code>group</code> - (string) the group of the record may be one of the given groups or a child of those.</li>       
 </ul>
 <p>The response to the query is an array of information objects looking like that:</p>  
<pre>
 [
   {
      "count" : 10000,
      "oldest" : 1442491494782,
      "newest" : 1442491882705,
      "calculated" : 1447336206527,
      "formats" : ["measurements"],
      "contents" : ["food/water"],
      "groups" : ["nutrition"],
      "newestRecord" : {"$oid":"55faadeae4b0b22590969f44"}
   },
   {
      "count" : 101,
      "oldest" : 1442491223087,
      "newest" : 1442491287684,
      "calculated" : 1447336206862,
      "formats" : ["measurements"],
      "contents" : ["activities/fairly-active","activities/more-active"],
      "groups": ["movement"],
      "newestRecord" : {"$oid":"55faab97e4b0b2259096744a"}
   }
 ]
</pre>                                  
<p>The grouping of records into summary objects depend on the "summarize" parameter. In the example they are summarized by "GROUP". 
   The meaning of the fields are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>count</code> The number of records</li>
  <li><code>oldest</code> timestamp of the oldest record</li>
  <li><code>newest</code> timestamp of the newest record</li>
  <li><code>calculated</code> calculation timestamp (internally used)</li>
  <li><code>formats</code> list of different formats of the records summarized in this entry</li>
  <li><code>contents</code> list of different contents of the records summarized in this entry</li>
  <li><code>groups</code> list of different groups of the records summarized in this entry</li>
  <li><code>newestRecord</code> _id of newest record in this group. May be used to fetch it in a separate search query</li> 
</ul>   
   
   
   
   
   
   
                                   
					</div>
					<div id="formats" class="tab-pane fade" ng-class="{ 'active in' : tab=='formats' }">
						<h2>List of data formats</h2>
						<p>The list of supported data formats is directly queried from the server and may be extended any time.</p>
						<h3>Format</h3>
						<p>These technical data formats are currently recognized by the server. The list contains development artifacts and may be cleaned up in the future.</p>
						<ul>
						  <li ng-repeat="format in formats">
						    <code>{{ format.format }}</code>
						  </li>
						</ul>
						<h3>Content</h3>
						<p>All semantical data types start with one of the following prefixes and a more detailed name after the slash. The prefix is used to place the record into a group. 
						   The assignment of content types to groups may be changed in the future.</p>
						<p> An example full content name (from Fitbit) is <code>activities/fairly-active</code>
						    with format <code>measurements</code>. 
						</p> 
						<table width="100%">						 
						  <tr>
						    <th>Prefix</th>
						    <th>Placed in group</th>
						    <th>Level of security applied</th>
						  </tr>
						  <tr ng-repeat="content in contents">
						    <td><code>{{ content.content }}/...</code></td>
						    <td>{{ content.group }}</td>
						    <td>{{ content.security }}</td>
						  </tr>
