id0114	14.06.2023	a.kreutz	F	Allow active Consents to non-Midata users.	Via API you can now create active Consents with people having no Midata account yet. The Consent will automatically have status proposed until the target user has registered an account. Afterwards it will be set to active automatically (unless it was rejected before).
id0115	10.07.2023	a.kreutz	F	Changes to User Groups	Midata "User Groups" (also called Teams) were previously either FHIR Group Resources or ResearchStudys. Now they may also correspond to an Organization or an HealthcareService (once HealthcareService is implemented). Members of Midata "User Groups" were previously always practitioners or researchers. Now DataBrokers (that is a new application type) and other Midata User Groups may also be a group member. Until now only researchers had specific permissions in a group. In non-project related groups all members were allowed to manage the group and to read/write the data. Now each group member may have specific permissions. Group membership is now transitive: If you are a member of a group (with a specific permission) that is member of another group (with the same permission) you also have access to that group (with the specific permission).
id0116	10.07.2023	a.kreutz	F	Changes to Security Tags	There is a new security tag "platform-mapped" which indicates that a FHIR resource represents an entity on the MIDATA platform despite beeing a normal FHIR resource. The following resources may be "platform-mapped" : Consent, Group, Practitioner, ResearchStudy, Organization, Patient, Person. "platform-mapped" Organizations may now be created and updated using the FHIR API. Each "platform-mapped" Organization has a corresponding Midata UserGroup. 
id0117	10.07.2023	a.kreutz	F	Changes to Organizations	Organizations may have a parent organization. This relationship is mirrored by the corresponding UserGroups: The suborganization has read/write access to the parent organization. The parent organization has management access to the suborganization. When creating Organizations through the FHIR API the managing person(s) may be provided using FHIR extensions. Write access permission to the Organization FHIR resource is now based on "manage" permission on the corresponding group. Organizations may now be grantees of Consents. The FHIR resource of an Organization that has been deleted on Midata is not deleted, but the "active" field of the resource is set to false.
id0118	10.07.2023	a.kreutz	F	New application type Data Broker	There is a new application type "Data Broker". The data broker is like an external service but may not directly access any patient data. Instead the data broker may be added as member to UserGroups. A group may be added to the authorization token which allows the data broker to act as this group (with the given permissions). The data broker may create or update Organizations and UserGroups using the API.
id0119	13.07.2023	a.kreutz	I	Allow use of national and separate international SMS service
id0120	20.07.2023	a.kreutz	I	Updated resources now contain their initial creation time	In the MIDATA meta block extension a new valueDateTime extension with name "createAt" with the initial creation time of the resource is available for all resources that have been updated.
id0121	29.08.2023	a.kreutz	I	Added grantee variables to consent notification emails
id0122	29.08.2023	a.kreutz	I	Added sender-user extension to FHIR message headers
id0123	14.11.2023	a.kreutz	F	Consent chaining	Consents may allow to reshare data with 3rd parties.
